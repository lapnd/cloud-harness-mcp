# Security model

## Intended use

Cloud Harness MCP is for one authenticated trusted owner, or a named set of
mutually trusted operators in one security domain, operating owner-approved
repositories. It is not an anonymous service, a general team sandbox, or a
hostile multi-tenant platform. Principal-qualified authorization prevents
accidental cross-operator access; it does not strengthen the shared-kernel
executor boundary.

`exec_run`, interactive shells and sessions, detached tasks, repository hooks,
skill scripts, and repository-defined deployments are intentional remote code
execution inside the executor. Public authentication controls who may request
that execution; it does not make the repository code trustworthy.

## Trust boundaries

Trusted control plane:

- the VPS, Docker daemon, deployment identity, nginx, API, runner, runtime
  configuration, and executor image;
- the rootful runner's Docker socket mount, which is host-root-equivalent
  authority.

Untrusted execution input:

- repository content, dependencies, Git metadata, hook and deployment
  manifests, skills, memories, and commands supplied through tools.

The API is deliberately separated from Docker authority. A credential-free
TCP proxy is the only Compose service with a loopback-published port. It joins
the API frontend network but not the API/runner control network, and the API
joins the internal frontend and control networks plus a dedicated egress
network required to retrieve the configured Cloudflare Access JWKS. JWKS
fetching remains limited by the verifier's fixed URL, redirect rejection,
timeouts, response bounds, and key-cache controls. The runner has no
published port and is the only service with `/var/run/docker.sock`; it uses a
separate egress network for DNS validation and optional GitHub App calls while
the API/runner control network remains internal.
The executor does not receive that socket, host credentials, or arbitrary host
mounts. The exact container flags are owned by
[`apps/runner/src/workspace-service.ts`](../apps/runner/src/workspace-service.ts);
Docker-backed checks live in
[`test/integration/docker-sandbox.docker.test.ts`](../test/integration/docker-sandbox.docker.test.ts).

Rootful Docker and a shared kernel remain the principal limitation. A runner
compromise can control the host, and a container escape crosses the executor
boundary. Do not expose this design to mutually distrustful tenants. That
requires a separate execution host or VM/microVM-grade boundary, quota-backed
storage, per-tenant identity/authorization, and stronger abuse controls. For the
architectural roadmap, hardware-isolated microVM criteria, and formal owner
gating governing future multi-tenant platform expansion, see
[`docs/adr/0001-multi-tenant-isolation-and-haas-ladder.md`](adr/0001-multi-tenant-isolation-and-haas-ladder.md).

## Public authentication and request controls

The default `owner-bearer` mode authenticates one long-lived replayable owner
secret and exposes MCP only. The opt-in `cloudflare-access` mode delegates
login, OAuth discovery/token issuance, and coarse admission to Cloudflare
Access. The origin derives identity only from the verified forwarded Access
assertion; the opaque client bearer is not interpreted as identity. The two
modes cannot be enabled ambiguously.

Access policies may offer GitHub and Google login, but Cloud Harness keys
authorization only on Access-normalized `(issuer, subject)`. Email and display
name are metadata, not linking signals. Subject recovery is an explicit,
collision-checked operator mapping with a redacted audit record; there is no
first-login or same-email takeover path. Cloudflare hostname ownership, Zero
Trust policy, IdP setup, revocation, and client compatibility remain external
operator controls that code and unit tests cannot prove.

The API checks hostname policy and an Origin allowlist before dispatch. In
Access mode, `/dashboard` additionally requires the Access assertion and
same-origin CSRF session for mutations. Browser responses use a strict
allowlist and must not contain the MCP/runner token, Access assertion, raw
secret, GitHub App credential, or minted provider token. The API also applies
bounded request size, process-local request/concurrency limits,
no-store/nosniff headers, and a runner deadline.

These controls are implemented in
[`apps/api/src/request-security.ts`](../apps/api/src/request-security.ts),
[`apps/api/src/auth.ts`](../apps/api/src/auth.ts), and
[`apps/api/src/app.ts`](../apps/api/src/app.ts). Process-local limits reset on
API restart and are not a distributed denial-of-service control.

Dashboard-managed API keys add a separate static-client lane without weakening
the Managed OAuth lane. The public `api.harness.zuey.me/mcp` Worker is a fixed
streaming proxy to exact `harness.zuey.me/mcp-api-key`: it rebuilds a small
header allowlist, discards caller-supplied Cloudflare and forwarding identity,
and injects its own Access service-token headers. The hidden origin path is
protected by a separate path-scoped Access application and audience. The
origin requires both a cryptographically verified assertion for the exactly
pinned gateway service subject and a valid principal-bound API key. Neither
credential is sufficient alone, and the reserved gateway subject is rejected
on the normal `/mcp` route. Before forwarding, the Worker enforces the
manifest-owned aggregate Rate Limiting binding and fails closed if the binding
cannot answer. That edge-local, eventually consistent cap is defense in depth;
the origin still enforces authoritative per-credential concurrency and request
limits. The executable owners are
[`apps/api-key-gateway/src/gateway.ts`](../apps/api-key-gateway/src/gateway.ts),
[`apps/api/src/auth.ts`](../apps/api/src/auth.ts), and
[`apps/runner/src/api-key-store.ts`](../apps/runner/src/api-key-store.ts).

An API key inherits its creator's full MCP authority, including arbitrary
remote command execution. It is not a fine-grained capability and has no tool
scopes. The browser can create, list, and revoke keys only through the existing
Access-authenticated, same-origin CSRF boundary. Plaintext is shown once;
SQLite retains only the SHA-256 digest and non-secret metadata. Expiry is
mandatory (configurable up to 3,650 days, approximately 10 years; choosing a longer lifetime lengthens exposure if the secret is compromised). Revocation takes effect on the next request, and authentication has
no positive cache. Treat disclosure as full account compromise: revoke the key,
inspect redacted audit and request metadata, and create a replacement only
after the leak path is closed.

In owner-bearer mode, rotate `MCP_BEARER_TOKEN` after suspected disclosure and
restart the API. In Access mode, revoke at Access/IdP and verify the edge no
longer forwards an accepted assertion. Rotate `RUNNER_TOKEN` independently and
restart both control services. Review logs for exposure before resuming
service; tokens must not appear in URLs, commands, documentation, or source
control.

## MCP gateway egress and credential resolution

The `/mcp-gateway` composition root adds the first user-configurable API egress
path in this system. Three facts define its boundary.

1. **The API dials principal-configured MCP URLs.** Endpoints are validated at
   write time and again before every request: https-only (cleartext HTTP only in
   `owner-bearer` mode, and only with both `MCP_GATEWAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP` and
   `MCP_GATEWAY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS`), no URL userinfo, query, or fragment,
   and rejection of loopback, private, link-local, CGNAT, and cloud-metadata
   targets. The socket is **pinned at connect time** to the addresses that
   validation resolved through a dedicated undici `Agent`, so a rebinding
   resolver cannot redirect a credentialed request. Redirects are refused, and
   the body and connection lifetime are bounded. This traffic uses only the
   API's dedicated egress network; the runner never dials a configured URL.
2. **The runner resolves referenced global secrets to the API over the existing
   service-token channel.** Resolution is scoped to one server and an explicit
   `execute` or `connect` purpose, is refused for a disabled server and for a
   denied or unknown tool on the `execute` path, and is audited as
   `mcp_gateway.credentials_resolved`. A resolved value never reaches a
   browser, tool result, trace, or log; error and text redaction covers raw and
   encoded forms. The API attaches the resolved headers only to a request whose
   origin and pathname equal the configured endpoint's — the MCP requests the
   server is configured for. A request to any other origin or path, including a
   redirect target, a discovery probe, or an OAuth metadata fetch, never carries
   them.
3. **Honest residual risk.** The API process heap becomes a place where a
   plaintext global secret exists while a credentialed downstream call is in
   flight, and because the principal chooses both the `secretRef` and the
   endpoint, a principal who references a secret authorizes sending that secret
   to that endpoint. **An API-process compromise is therefore a global-secret
   compromise**, and the URL policy, socket pinning, header scoping, and
   redaction limit that exposure without eliminating it. Treat API-process
   memory as secret-bearing: do not attach debuggers, heap dumps, or core dumps
   to a running API, and rotate the referenced secrets if that boundary is
   crossed.

## Executor and repository controls

Executors run as a non-root UID with a read-only root filesystem, dropped
capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, bounded CPU/memory/PIDs/file descriptors,
bounded per-operation and aggregate retained output, bounded operation-handle
counts, and TTL cleanup. Only the workspace repository mount is writable.

The shipped default executor network profile is `dependency-access`, so a
workspace can reach the GitHub API and the bundled `gh` CLI without an explicit
request. `network-none` is the per-workspace or instance-wide opt-out that
blocks all executor egress, including dependency installation and networked
repository commands. The dashboard Settings page owns that instance-wide default
through dashboard-only internal runner operations; it is instance state rather
than principal state, so in a deployment that serves more than one principal any
authenticated dashboard principal can change the posture of future workspaces.
That matches the single-owner threat model this harness is built for; a
multi-tenant deployment needs an admin gate on the settings mutation before it
can rely on per-principal policy. The `dependency-access` profile is enforced below MCP
tool policy: the executor attaches only to a dedicated managed Docker bridge
(`chm-egress0`) with inter-container communication disabled and Docker's
default masquerade off, and a transactional host firewall (installed via a
single `iptables-restore` commit and verified through an ephemeral
`NET_ADMIN`-only network-guard container) permits only public DNS and public
TCP 80/443. The managed jump is the first rule of both `INPUT` and
`DOCKER-USER`, and forbidden destination classes — loopback-to-host,
Docker/control-plane, RFC 1918, carrier-grade NAT, link-local, and
cloud-metadata (`169.254.169.254`) — are rejected before the allowed ports.
IPv6 is disabled on the bridge. The runner attests the Docker network and the
exact ordered host ruleset before every dependency executor start and during
periodic reaper reconciliation; on drift it fences the workspace to
`NETWORK_QUARANTINED`, stops the executor, and retains its data for recovery
after policy reconciliation. If attestation is unavailable the profile fails
closed (`DEPENDENCY_EGRESS_UNAVAILABLE`) and never falls back to broad bridge
egress. `dependency-access` is not an allowlisted proxy or DLP boundary: it
still permits exfiltration and callbacks to public endpoints. Production
enforcement targets Linux with the Docker iptables backend; the host firewall
is a trusted operator-owned control outside the executor's authority.

Repository opening accepts only credential-free HTTPS URLs on configured
hosts and rejects private/link-local resolutions. The operator may exempt named
hosts from the private-range check with `PRIVATE_GIT_HOSTS` (an internal Git
server); loopback, link-local and cloud-metadata addresses are never exempt.
A non-GitHub host credential (`GIT_TOKEN_<HOST>`) is supplied over stdin only
to helpers talking to that host, exactly like a GitHub token, and GitHub
credentials are never offered to a non-GitHub host. The clone helper disables
hooks, recursive submodules, tag downloads, redirects, and LFS smudging.
Repository code is never evaluated by the runner during clone.

Optional GitHub App credentials remain in the runner. Access GitHub SSO never
grants repository access. A separate principal-bound App installation and
verified repository grant authorize private Git operations. Short-lived,
repository-scoped tokens are supplied over stdin only to ephemeral clone,
fetch, or push helpers; the stored remote stays credential-free and the helper
environment never receives a token. Remote fetch/pull first stage outside the
executor and import without network or credentials. Push first stages a bare
snapshot without credentials, then uses a separate networked helper. Transfer
directories and helper containers are removed after the operation.

#### Operator-supplied GitHub credential fallback

A GitHub App is optional. When no App repository token can be minted, Git and
`github_action` operations fall back to an operator-supplied GitHub credential,
resolved in this order:

1. `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`, from the runner process environment (each
also accepting a `_FILE` form); then
2. an active global runtime secret named `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`, held by
the requesting principal.

The environment source is honored **only** in `owner-bearer` mode. In
`cloudflare-access` (multi-principal) mode it is refused entirely, because a
single operator-wide credential must never stand in for a different
principal's App grant; those deployments use the per-principal secret instead.
Values that cannot be GitHub credentials (shorter than 20 characters or
containing whitespace) are ignored, so an unrelated environment variable or
secret cannot be sent to GitHub as a token. Resolved credentials are registered
with the ingest-time redactor. The owning resolution logic and its tests are
[`apps/runner/src/github-credential-fallback.ts`](../apps/runner/src/github-credential-fallback.ts)
and
[`apps/runner/test/github-credential-fallback.test.ts`](../apps/runner/test/github-credential-fallback.test.ts).

This fallback is deliberately weaker than an App token: a personal access token
is not scoped to one repository and cannot be bounded by an installation grant,
so prefer the narrowest fine-grained token, or a GitHub App where one is
practical.

### Owner-scoped repository cache isolation

When repository caching is enabled (`enableRepoCache: true`):

1. Bare repository caches are stored under `repoCacheRoot` partitioned strictly by the authenticated principal's opaque ID (`<repoCacheRoot>/<principalId>/...`). Cross-principal cache access is structurally impossible.
2. Cache initialization uses ephemeral helper containers that mount the owner's cache directory writable (`:rw`) to clone the bare repository mirror. Once READY, existing mirrors are referenced without ongoing background synchronization.
3. Initial workspace checkouts mount the cache directory strictly read-only (`:ro`) in the clone helper and use `git clone --reference-if-able <cache> --dissociate <workspace>`. The `--dissociate` flag copies referenced objects into the workspace repository during creation, severing any ongoing link to the shared object store before the executor starts.
4. Checkouts are fully independent and writable only to their own workspace; no writable Git state is ever shared across workspaces or principals.

### Brokered GitHub actions

Authenticated GitHub operations (`pr_list`, `pr_view`, `pr_create`, `pr_update`, `pr_comment`, `issue_list`, `issue_view`, `issue_create`, `issue_comment`, `issue_comment_update`, `label_create`, `issue_labels_add`, `issue_labels_remove`, `issue_update`, `issue_publish`) are executed through the `github_action` tool using an ephemeral helper container (`worker/gh-helper.sh`). Action-scoped tokens (`pull_requests: read|write`, `issues: read|write`, each also carrying `contents: read`) are minted by the runner from the trusted GitHub App installation, or resolved from the operator fallback described above when no App token is available, and passed exclusively via `stdin`. The accompanying `contents: read` is required for the action to work at all: `gh` resolves repository metadata (such as `defaultBranchRef`) over the GraphQL API, and GitHub refuses those fields for a token narrowed to the action scope alone. The helper container runs read-only with dropped capabilities, and is forcibly removed on all exit paths in a `try/finally` block. Credentials resolved this way never enter the helper environment, workspace filesystem, workspace environment, client result, or audit payload.

The read-only `commit_list`, `compare`, `release_list`, and `tag_list` actions mint a `contents: read`-scoped token directly (no `pull_requests`/`issues` scope needed) and are reachable through either `github_action` or the non-destructive `github_read` tool, which shares this broker and helper so read-only calls do not carry `github_action`'s tool-level destructive annotation.

All write mutations and token authorization denials emit auditable events (`github_action.<action>`) into `audit_events` recording principal, repository, target entity numbers, success status, and structured error codes without storing token secrets or unbounded request payloads. Helper execution failures are classified into structured, typed error codes (`GITHUB_RATE_LIMITED` with retryAfterMs, `GITHUB_PERMISSION_MISSING`, `INVALID_PULL_REQUEST_BASE`, `GITHUB_ACTION_FAILED`) to provide deterministic machine-readable recovery semantics for autonomous agents.

### Three-zone storage and toolchain isolation

Executors operate across three partitioned storage zones:

1. **Zone A (Secrets & Session Config)**: `/tmp/cloud-harness-home` backed by RAM tmpfs (`128MB`), containing ephemeral configurations, temporary tokens, and tool cache metadata. Destroyed on container exit and cannot be committed into Git.
2. **Zone B (User-Space Toolchains & Caches)**: `/opt/user-tools` and `/var/cache/harness` mounted from runner-managed job paths with UID `10001:10001` ownership and mode `0755`. Accommodates global user-space toolchain installations (`npm -g`, `bun`, `uv`, `pnpm`, `wrangler`) without requiring root.
3. **Zone C (Git Repository)**: `/workspace` containing the clean repository working tree.

Workspace disk usage metering calculates the combined footprint of all three persistent zones against `maxWorkspaceBytes`.

### Skill tiers and execution isolation

Skills are resolved across four deterministic precedence tiers (`built-in > owner > workspace > repository`):

1. **Built-in & Owner Tiers (`/opt/cloud-harness/skills:ro`, `/opt/cloud-harness/owner-skills:ro`)**: Mounted read-only (`:ro`) at the container boundary. Because they reside on immutable host mounts, processes within the executor (including any process running as UID 10001) cannot modify these skill files.
2. **Workspace & Repository Tiers (`/workspace/.cloud-harness/skills`, `/workspace/.agents/skills`)**: Reside on the mutable working tree volume. Execution creates an isolated snapshot under `/tmp/cloud-harness-exec/<runId>` and validates the full-tree bundle digest and script SHA before invocation to prevent unintentional concurrent filesystem race conditions. Within the single-tenant container boundary, all processes share UID 10001; users requiring kernel-enforced mount immutability should install skills into the `owner` scope. A skill revision that carries instructions but no scripts is refused with `NO_EXECUTABLE_ASSETS` rather than a generic miss, because the revision exists and simply has nothing to run. Where those bytes execute is a deliberate choice, not an accident: the script runs in a disposable helper container launched through `runPrivilegedEphemeralExec`, which is gated on an owner privilege grant. Without a grant the runner returns `PRIVILEGE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` naming the grant it needs, and it never falls back to running the script locally, so a caller cannot read a stronger isolation guarantee into the result than the run actually had. The response reports `executionMode: 'helper-container'`. The helper container reuses the worker's one-shot entry point, so the isolated snapshot, the full-tree bundle digest, and the script SHA checks described here still happen before the script is invoked; only the process that finally runs it moves into a container of its own.

### Privileged execution and operator approval grants

Standard executors strictly preserve `--read-only`, `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, and user `10001:10001`. Sudo/root execution is treated as an explicit owner-approved threat model weakening (similar to `networkMode: bridge`).

When `exec_run` is invoked with `privileged: true`:

1. Privileged execution is supported in `cloudflare-access` mode (where the operator dashboard is authenticated via Cloudflare Access) and is disabled in `owner-bearer` mode to prevent self-approval.
2. In `cloudflare-access` mode, an unapproved request is rejected with `PRIVILEGE_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` and returns a single-use `grantId` bound to the command and working directory with a 60-second TTL.
3. The operator must explicitly approve the grant via the authenticated Dashboard BFF API (`POST /api/v1/privilege-grants/:grantId/approve`). MCP clients cannot self-approve.
4. The caller provides the `approvalGrantToken`. The runner validates the grant and command/cwd hash, atomically consumes it (single-use), and executes the command in an isolated ephemeral container with `try/finally` cleanup. The standard executor container remains permanently hardened and unmodified.
The public contract fixes remote transfers to `origin`, permits only branch
push refspecs, rejects deletion refspecs, and permits force only through
force-with-lease. Private clone/fetch/pull require GitHub App Contents read
access, or the operator fallback above; push requires Contents read and write
access, or the operator fallback above. The executable boundary
and its evidence are
[`apps/runner/src/workspace-service.ts`](../apps/runner/src/workspace-service.ts),
[`worker/git-transfer-helper.sh`](../worker/git-transfer-helper.sh),
[`apps/runner/test/git-transfer-leak.test.ts`](../apps/runner/test/git-transfer-leak.test.ts),
and
[`test/integration/git-transfer-helper.docker.test.ts`](../test/integration/git-transfer-helper.docker.test.ts).
Live private-repository verification remains owner-supplied evidence.

### Secrets management and ingest-time stream redaction

Cloud Harness provides credential management partitioned by scope, lifecycle, and encryption boundaries:

1. **Secret Scopes and Precedence:**
   - **Global Secrets:** Active global runtime secrets are bound to the authenticated principal identity and automatically inherited by every remote Docker workspace created by that principal.
   - **Environment Secrets:** Scoped to a specific project environment. Injected only when the client explicitly provides both `environmentId` and `confirmEnvironmentInjection: true` in `workspace_open`.
   - **Precedence Rule:** When a key collision occurs, environment secrets override global secrets with the same name.
   - **Local Stdio Limitation:** Retained secret discovery and injection are unsupported in local stdio workspaces.

2. **Purpose Classification:**
   - Secrets have a `purpose` attribute (`runtime` vs `provisioning`). Only `runtime` secrets are injected into executor container environments; `provisioning` secrets are excluded from runtime container injection.

3. **Encryption at Rest & Write-Only Boundary:**
   - Secret values are write-only through the authenticated, CSRF-protected Dashboard BFF API.
   - Submitted values are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM via the versioned runner keyring (`SECRET_KEYRING_FILE`). Ciphertext is stored in SQLite (`secret_versions`, `global_secret_versions`, `workspace_secret_snapshots`, `workspace_secret_snapshot_headers`).
   - Neither the browser dashboard nor MCP tools (`secrets_list`) ever return secret values or ciphertext.
   - During executor creation, runtime secrets are briefly written to an ephemeral mode-0600 host environment file for Docker creation and immediately removed.

4. **GitHub Credential Injection (Explicit Owner-Approved Weakening):**
   - `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are accepted secret names, unlike every other control-plane, GitHub App, and toolchain name, so an operator can authenticate the executor's bundled `gh` CLI without an interactive login.
   - Because they are ordinary runtime secrets, they are also inherited by every remote workspace of that principal (global scope) or by the selected project environment, and any process in the executor can read them. This is the only harness-supported path that places a repository credential inside an executor environment, and it is an operator opt-in rather than a default: no secret exists unless the operator creates one.
   - Egress is the shipped default, so a credential readable by repository-controlled code is exfiltratable by that code. Mitigate by using a fine-grained token limited to the repositories the workspace needs, or by switching the instance default or the individual workspace back to `network-none`.
   - `GITHUB_APP_*`, `RUNNER_*`, `ACCESS_*`, `CF_*`, `CLOUDFLARE_*`, `HARNESS_*`, `CH_*`, `DOCKER_*`, `XDG_*`, `NPM_*`, `UV_*`, `BUN_*`, `PNPM_*`, `GIT_*`, and `LD_*` names remain reserved and are rejected at both the dashboard and runner boundaries.

5. **Ingest-Time Stream Redaction (Defense-in-Depth):**
   - Secret values meeting the minimum length threshold (≥ 4 UTF-8 bytes) are compiled into the runner's streaming redactor.
   - Streaming task, shell, and session stdout/stderr chunks are sanitized—including matches spanning stream chunk boundaries—before retained memory buffering, preserving monotonic byte cursor offsets. Synchronous `exec_run` command outputs and worker error messages are sanitized after capture before return.
   - Redaction is defense-in-depth: it targets exact raw byte matches and does not match transformed, encoded (e.g., base64 or hex), hashed, or partial secret derivatives. Repository code and commands must not deliberately echo secret material.

Repository-manifest deployments are named commands, not a secret broker. They
execute with the same unprivileged executor environment and network mode as
other repository commands; the harness does not inject host or deployment
credentials. Their manifest parsing and execution owner is
[`worker/harness-worker.mjs`](../worker/harness-worker.mjs).

## Storage and state limits

Workspace paths are server-generated and checked beneath the configured jobs
root. Worker paths reject absolute/traversal paths and symlink escapes. SQLite
stores workspace/principal, project/environment, encrypted-secret reference,
hashed API-key metadata, GitHub installation, artifact metadata, and redacted
audit state. Artifact
payloads use a separate runner-confined bounded root. Raw secret values are
encrypted with a versioned runner-held keyring and are never returned to the
browser; the keyring and GitHub App private key never cross into API, ingress,
or executor surfaces. Their executable owners are
[`apps/runner/src/metadata-store.ts`](../apps/runner/src/metadata-store.ts),
[`apps/runner/src/artifact-store.ts`](../apps/runner/src/artifact-store.ts), and
[`apps/runner/src/secret-keyring.ts`](../apps/runner/src/secret-keyring.ts).

Repository files may remain private to executor UID 10001. The runner meters
an active workspace with a fixed command inside its executor and checks a
newly cloned workspace with a no-network, capability-free helper mounted
read-only on the generated workspace path. A transient measurement failure is
retryable and does not close the workspace; only a successful measurement over
the ceiling triggers cleanup. If the host UID cannot remove executor-owned
files, cleanup uses a separate fixed no-network, capability-free helper;
startup reaps interrupted ephemeral helpers.

The current storage ceiling is not a hard quota. Per-principal workspace
admission, a host free-space floor, operation-boundary checks, and periodic
reaping reduce risk, but a process can still fill the shared filesystem between
checks. The shipped `MAX_ACTIVE_WORKSPACES_PER_OWNER` default already permits three
counted workspaces per principal, and raising it multiplies the per-workspace
container bounds rather than replacing them: every counted workspace keeps its own
memory, CPU, pid, and byte limits, and only their number grows.
Monitor the host and use a dedicated quota-backed filesystem before accepting
untrusted workloads.

The GitHub Actions SSH identity is separate from the operator's normal key and
must be installed with OpenSSH `restrict` plus the root-owned deploy forced
command. The wrapper accepts only the fixed deploy action and one exact commit
SHA, so broader privileges on the interactive operator account are not exposed
through the automation key.

Close/TTL removes the executor and workspace directory. Shell/session/task
state is in-memory and disappears on runner restart. Startup restarts surviving
executors to stop processes whose handles were lost; this remains a durability
limitation, not a security guarantee.

## Local stdio security model

Local stdio mode intentionally alters the trust boundary compared to the remote Docker executor:

### Host authority vs Docker isolation

- Commands executed in local mode (`exec_run`, shells, sessions, tasks) run with the authority of the current host user.
- File path confinement ensures that tool-supplied file paths and working directories cannot resolve outside the canonical workspace root.
- **Path confinement is not an OS command sandbox.** A command running under `exec_run` or in a shell can still access anything accessible to the host user. Never claim local stdio mode is a sandboxed environment.

### Filesystem confinement policy

- The workspace root is canonicalized once at startup from the `--workspace` argument using `realpath`.
- Relative paths, lexical traversal (`..`), absolute paths, and null bytes are rejected before resolution.
- Symlinks are resolved against the canonical root; attempts to escape via symlinks or parent symlinks fail with a structured error.
- `workspace_close` is terminal and idempotent: it terminates child processes and marks the workspace closed, but **never deletes or modifies the user's project folder**.

### Environment curation and secret isolation

- Child subprocesses do not inherit the complete host environment.
- An allowlist provides standard system variables (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `SHELL`, `LANG`, etc.).
- Cloud Harness tokens, bearer secrets, GitHub App credentials, session secrets, and database URLs are actively scrubbed.
- Reserved control prefixes (`HARNESS_*`, `CH_*`) cannot be overridden by tool input.
- Additional host environment variables can be explicitly forwarded via `--env <NAME>`.

### Process cleanup

- Local long-running children are launched in POSIX process groups.
- Cancellation, workspace close, signal receipt (SIGINT, SIGTERM), and process exit trigger process-group termination (`SIGTERM` followed by a grace period and `SIGKILL` escalation).

### Network Git and push opt-ins

- Network Git operations (`git_fetch`, `git_pull`) and Git push (`git_push`) are disabled by default in local mode.
- Enabling them requires explicit startup flags (`--git-network` and `--git-push`).
- Local Git operations use the user's existing checkout configuration and credentials only when authorized by these flags.

### Unsupported capabilities

- `exec_run` with `privileged: true`, `github_action`, and `github_read` are unsupported in local v1 and return immediate structured capability errors.

## Repository capability introspection and authorization preflight

To prevent late-stage workflow failures where an agent completes extensive edits before discovering that pushing or publishing is unauthorized, Cloud Harness exposes preflight authorization state:

- **`workspace_capabilities` and `workspace_status`:** Inspectable at any point without modifying state, minting tokens, or launching containers. Returns structured `capabilities.repository` (`read`, `push`, `issuesRead`, `issuesWrite`, `pullRequestsRead`, `pullRequestsWrite`), `permissions`, and `operations`.
- **Policy-driven derivation:** Capabilities reflect Cloud Harness security policy:
  - In `owner-bearer` mode, write capabilities require a configured GitHub App installation on GitHub repositories.
  - In `cloudflare-access` mode, write capabilities are derived from verified GitHub App installation grants bound to the authenticated principal.
  - In local stdio mode, capabilities reflect explicit operator flags (`--git-push`, `--git-network`).
- **Structured denial error:** Unauthorized operations reject immediately with `REPOSITORY_OPERATION_NOT_AUTHORIZED` (403, non-retryable) indicating the exact `operation`, `repository`, and `requiredCapability` (e.g. `repository.push`, `repository.issuesWrite`, `repository.pullRequestsWrite`).

## Provenance and workspace context security model

Cloud Harness MCP provides vendor-neutral coding context across AI agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, Aider) while maintaining strict boundaries against prompt injection and privilege escalation:

### Passive discovery and zero execution

- `workspace_context` passively inspects known allowlisted instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.aider.conf.yml`), language manifests, and declared test commands.
- Passive discovery performs **zero script executions**, invokes no package managers, and triggers no Git hooks.
- Files are read under strict size and time bounds (max 256 candidate files, 250ms deadline, 32 KiB default response budget).

### Immutable provenance attribution

- Provenance (`source`, `trust`, `mutableBy`, `contentSha256`, `discoveredAt`) is assigned exclusively by the trusted Runner control plane based on physical boundary locations:
  - `built-in` (`trust: trusted-control-plane`, `mutableBy: release`)
  - `owner` (`trust: owner-controlled`, `mutableBy: owner`)
  - `workspace` (`trust: untrusted-executor`, `mutableBy: workspace-process`)
  - `repository` (`trust: untrusted-executor`, `mutableBy: repository-commit`)
- Repository text claiming `source: built-in` or `source: owner` is ignored; the Runner stamps canonical repository provenance.

### Adversarial output-boundary containment

- In `structuredContent`, repository text is encapsulated inside `data.manifest.items` under `trust: untrusted-executor`.
- In text projections (`content[0].text`), items are formatted with trusted boundary markers and JSON-escaped excerpts to prevent delimiter breakout or fake system header forgery.
- Malicious instructions in repository files cannot create persistent SQLite memories without explicit authenticated tool mutation calls.

### Scoped SQLite memories with optimistic concurrency

- Memories are stored in SQLite `StateStore` (schema v5), isolated by `principal_id`:
  - `owner`: Principal-wide, persistent across workspaces
  - `repository`: Scoped to `(principal_id, repository_key)`, persistent across workspaces for that repository
  - `workspace`: Scoped to `(principal_id, workspace_id)`, reaped when the workspace is closed
- Mutations enforce Optimistic Concurrency Control via `expectedGeneration` (CAS) and automatic TTL expiration.

### Declarative lifecycle hooks & sandboxed execution

- Hooks are defined in `.cloud-harness/hooks.json` supporting declarative JSON format with named lifecycle events (`on_workspace_open`, `post_checkout`, `pre_commit`, `post_commit`, `manual`).
- Automatic lifecycle execution requires explicit owner activation (`hooks_activate`) pinned to the exact manifest SHA-256 digest.
- Modifying the hook script or manifest invalidates activation and blocks execution before process spawn.
- All hooks execute in unprivileged executor containers with `networkMode: none` by default, no broker credentials, and no Docker socket.

### Third-Party Agent Toolkits & Provisioning Network Firewall

- **Network-isolated helpers:** Ephemeral helper containers run on a dedicated `cloud-harness-provisioning` network (`internal: true`) with no default gateway. Direct raw TCP sockets fail with `ENETUNREACH`.
- **Dual-homed egress proxy:** All outbound provisioning traffic is forced through `provisioning-proxy:3128`. The proxy enforces destination allowlists (`allowedGitHosts` + catalog endpoints), blocks private IP ranges (RFC1918), loopback, and cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`), and connects directly to validated numeric IPs to prevent DNS rebinding.
- **Secret Purpose Classification:** Secrets are marked `purpose: "runtime" | "provisioning"`. Provisioning-only keys are delivered exclusively via stdin pipe to ephemeral helpers on tmpfs and are strictly excluded from runtime container environments (`docker inspect`).
- **Operator-provided `built-in` skills are trusted control-plane content:** a `BUILTIN_SKILLS_ROOT` directory is mounted read-only into every executor at `/opt/cloud-harness/skills`, the tier that outranks owner, workspace, and repository skills. The harness never writes to it, never copies it into the toolkit cache, and reports its provenance as `built-in` / `trusted-control-plane`; the runner rescans that same host directory when building the context manifest, so the mounted partition and the attributed one cannot diverge. `BUILTIN_SKILLS_ROOT` is the single reserved name for this tier: a caller can never supply it as workspace environment, and the worker falls back to the fixed `/opt/cloud-harness/skills` mount target when it is unset. Because the tier wins name resolution, an operator hosting content there — including licensed vendor material on their own host — overrides same-named skills from any other tier; that precedence is deliberate and is why the mount is operator-only and never caller-selectable. `skills_run` still requires the caller to pin the approved bundle digest, so a tampered script cannot be executed by replaying an older digest.
- **Licensed kit content is verified before it becomes owner-skills:** the `agentkit` toolkit kind is the only source that reads a paid, registry-published artifact. The runner resolves the signed manifest with the principal's stored licence token, verifies the manifest's Ed25519 signature against the pinned `AGENTKIT_REGISTRY_KEY_ID`/`AGENTKIT_REGISTRY_PUBLIC_KEY`, downloads the pre-signed artifact, and verifies its SHA-256 against that signed manifest before a single member is unpacked. No caller-supplied credential, key, or artifact URL is accepted, and a missing key or credential fails closed. Because the content is licensed rather than public, the kind is `owner`-scoped only: it is mounted read-only and never materialized into a repository that could later be published. Package inspection and extraction run in network-disabled helper containers (`--network none`, UID 10001, `--read-only`, `--cap-drop ALL`, `no-new-privileges`), archive members are validated as kit-relative before extraction, and the extracted tree must contain exactly one kit root with no pipes, sockets, or device nodes. The licence token must be a `provisioning`-purpose global secret, which the runtime envelope injection excludes; a `runtime`-purpose token is refused with `INVALID_INPUT`. The token is read from the secret store at resolve time and never enters the executor.

### Subagent Model Provider Credential Isolation & Gateway Control

- **Zero Credential Exposure:** Provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Google, Custom) are write-only, encrypted in StateStore (schema v9) via `SecretKeyring` (AES-256-GCM) with domain-separated AAD (`purpose: "model_provider_credential"`). Keys are never injected into workspace environment variables, executor containers, or Pi subagent containers.
- **Framed Stdin Control Transport:** Gateway configuration snapshots and credentials travel strictly over stdin via `docker exec -i` to the Gateway's internal Unix domain socket (`mode 0600`), ensuring secrets never appear in command-line arguments, environment variables, or disk logs.
- **RAM-Only Active Projections:** Model Gateway retains active credentials and profile revisions exclusively in memory. When rotating a credential, an atomic swap updates the active slot while in-flight requests safely complete with the prior key reference before it is zeroed.
- **Strict SSRF Guard on Custom Endpoints:** Custom upstream endpoints are strictly validated for public HTTPS origins on default port 443. Private IPv4/IPv6, loopback, link-local, AWS metadata (`169.254.169.254`), query strings, userinfo, and redirects are blocked at apply-time and request socket connection.
- **Read-only Owner Injection:** Toolkits selected under `owner` scope are projected to `/job/toolkit-projection/owner-skills/` and mounted read-only at `/opt/cloud-harness/owner-skills:ro`, keeping `git status --porcelain` 100% clean.
